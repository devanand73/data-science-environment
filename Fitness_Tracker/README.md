## Fitness Tracker Project Goal

Create Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a machine learning model that can classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.

## The quantified self
• The quantified self is any individual engaged in the self-tracking of any kind of biological, physical, behavioral, or environmental information. The self-tracking is driven by a certain goal of the individual, with a desire to act upon the collected information — Hoogendoorn, M., & Funk, B. (2018). Machine learning for the quantified self. On the art of learning from sensory data.

# Following steps performed to Solve the project goal

. Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning
  Read all the separate raw CSV files, process them, and merge them into a single DataFrame

• Visualizing data, plotting time series data

• Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor

• Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering

• Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network

• Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm

## what are Anaconda channels?
   Anaconda is a software tool that helps people with data science and machine learning. It has a package manager called conda that lets people easily install and update different tools. Channels are places where people can find these tools. Anaconda provides default channels, but people can also make their own or use third-party channels. Channels help make sure all the tools work together and can be specified in different ways in conda. They help manage package dependencies and ensure compatibility between packages.
