## Fitness Tracker Project Goal

Create Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a machine learning model that can classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.

## The quantified self
• The quantified self is any individual engaged in the self-tracking of any kind of biological, physical, behavioral, or environmental information. The self-tracking is driven by a certain goal of the individual, with a desire to act upon the collected information — Hoogendoorn, M., & Funk, B. (2018). Machine learning for the quantified self. On the art of learning from sensory data.

# Following steps performed to Solve the project goal

. Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning

• Visualizing data, plotting time series data

• Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor

• Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering

• Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network

• Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm
